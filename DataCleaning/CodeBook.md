run_analysis.R
--------------
Data is loaded into temporary variables from raw files. Appropriate column names are used during this process to identify the data types.

Data is merged into one variable __one__ that contains the test and train data sets.

The type of data (ie: Standing, walking, etc) is given a __Description__ in a new field contained in the data set. 

Measurements are calculated to extract a tidy dataset.
